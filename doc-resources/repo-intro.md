The **fortify-ssc-parser-util** project provides various utility classes for implementing custom SSC parser plugins. For now, this is mostly oriented at parser plugins that need to parse JSON or XML data, however support for 
other input formats may be added in the future.

The main purpose of this project is to separate the technical aspects of parsing JSON or XML data, from the functional logic for handling actual JSON or XML contents. As such, this project provides utility classes that handle the technical parsing aspects, such that parser plugin implementations can focus on the functional logic for handling actual contents.
